I've got a cool veranda
Where I keep my question and my answer
I've got a cool veranda
In my subliminal remember
Genetic codes of I ancestors
The mystic of original stargazer

I've got a cool veranda
Locked in my subliminal remember
I look at the truth as a nectar
That will sweeten up the sour and the bitter
I've got a cool veranda
Locked in my subliminal remember

I've got to use my connector
I will pour the libations in my slumber
I've got a cool veranda
Locked in my subliminal remember

Old battles with new wine
A battle in the smoke of a one and only kind
I accept the sun anywhere that in shine
Where I see generosity I respond in kind
Where I see integrity I respond in kind

A cool veranda
Where I keep my question and my answer
I've got a cool veranda
In my subliminal remember

Empower the ghetto youth inna your border
Separate the Queen from the danger
Separate the Newborn from the cancer
Give the youths something to strive for

A cool veranda
Where I keep my question and my answer
A cool veranda
In my subliminal remember

Navigate the infinite on a mustard seed
The 8 is the double triangle
And the august seed
Horseman cubit is the dangerous lead
Come watch the turtle take the lead
Watch the little turtle take the lead
With a cool veranda
In my subliminal remember
I've got a cool veranda
Where I keep my question and my answer

Hanging in the back of my mind
Are the windows to worlds
And the answers to signs

A cool veranda
That's where I keep my question and my answer

I look at the truth as a nectar
It will sweeten up the sour and the bitter
I've got a cool veranda
In my subliminal remember
Striving through solar systems forever
I will navigate on one of Saturn's rings
At the apex of Mount Zion the Sons of Jah sing
Even the stones raise up to praise Selassie-I King
With a cool... be with a cool, oh
With a cool veranda
Where I keep my question and my answer
Oh, oh, oh...
